                The Winners Treasure Hunt is a contextual based augmented reality app that allows 
                visitors to find prizes hidden virtually at Winners locations and designed to gamify 
                and further emphasize their unique retail experience.

      <h4 id="project-title">Enhancing the Winners in-store experience</h4>
      <h5 id="project-description">
        We were tasked with designing an imaginative solution to improve the retail experience 
        of Winners, and enhance how customers discover and purchase apparel. By their own words, 
        the Winners shopping experience is that of a “Treasure Hunt.” We wanted to emphasize 
        this experience through a unique AR application where visitors can search for a 
        variety of randomized promotions in store.
      </h5>
      <h4 id="project-title">My Role</h4>
      <h5 id="project-description">
        The team consisted of 4 UX designers, including myself. I was in charge of completing 
        the final mockups and demo scenarios, ensuring that the product aligned with the Winners 
        brand and overall team vision by bringing together all our pieces of work from video, 
        text descriptions and user interface flows into one cohesive piece. 
      </h5>
      <h4 id="project-title">Who’s it for?</h4>
      <h5>
        The Winners Treasure Hunt is for any Winners customer. This includes all adults, teens, and 
        children with parent or guardian consent.

      <h4 id="project-title">Research</h4>
      <h5 id="project-description">
        As described, our main takeaway was that Winners see their shopping experience as a 
        treasure hunt, which informed the direction of the Winners Treasure Hunt. We took 
        inspiration from Pokemon GO and other 3D navigation apps and games for navigation 
        and motion. We also made sure to reference images of Winners and their online media 
        to determine its visual language.</h5>

        We made sure to visit physical Winners Locations to get a sense of the layout in respect 
        to the main clothing areas. We designed a simple layout in Bezi to illustrate this.

        <h4 id="project-title">Designing a User Flow</h4>
        <h5 id="project-description">
          After visiting the stores, we designed a flow that the game would follow intuitively 
          through the store. The whole experience and flow will be discussed in the final deliverables 
          section.

          Next, we created our interface flow and elements for initial game prompts and the two types 
          of wayfinding. We were keen on making sure to iterate on the elements and make sure they are 
          visible in AR against the busy store aesthetics.

        <h4 id="project-title">1. QR Code and Initial Prompts</h4>
        <h5 id="project-description">
          Visitors will initiate the game by scanning the QR Code at the front of the store.
          <br><br>
          Visitors are prompted for their information and what they are looking for. This 
          will let the game know where to generate treasure. For example, if they are looking 
          for shirts, the game will generate treasure in the shirts area.

          of the pink arrow.

  <!----TLDR---->
  <div class="content-container" id="project">
    <div class="project-details">
      <h4 id="project-title">From Pain Point to Selling Point</h4>
      <h5 id="project-description">
        At the start of the project, our team had initially all seen the Winners shopping 
        experience as a pain point. We disliked how there was no “proper” inventory or collection 
        of items and wanted to design something that would allow visitors to more easily find items 
        they wanted. After further research, we learned that this treasure hunt shopping experience 
        was actually a feature, not a bug. This was the catalyst for how the Winners Treasure Hunt 
        turned out to be in its final form, and we were glad this insight changed our direction.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the Winners Treasure Hunt is an opportunity for visitors to experience shopping 
        at Winners using emerging technologies, while maintaining the surprise factor they know and love. 
        This project allowed me to use my previous digital media skills in After Effects
